# About Typhon SL
## The idea
A good friend of mine ask me to design him a durable 7" and 9" frame that is based on the Typhon 5/6 Inch race frame.  This friend only flies 7, 9 and 10" frames these days and he wanted something durable but racey.  This design is super durable and you will also find 9" arms if you would like to have a 9" build, but it will not meet the specifications for the SL if you use the 9" arms.

Typhon
Typhon (/ˈtaɪfɒn, -fən/; Greek: Τυφῶν, [typʰɔ̂ːn]), also Typhoeus (/taɪˈfiːəs/; Τυφωεύς), Typhaon (Τυφάων) or Typhos (Τυφώς), was a monstrous serpentine giant and one of the deadliest creatures in Greek mythology. According to Hesiod, Typhon was the son of Gaia and Tartarus. However, one source has Typhon as the son of Hera alone, while another makes Typhon the offspring of Cronus. Typhon and his mate Echidna were the progenitors of many famous monsters.

## Project naming requirements
Typhon SL is the name of the frame.  If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON SL”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have used as basis of the project, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON SL”.

If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between TYPHON SL and your project.
Accessories from the TYPHON SL project also needs to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON SL FPV Camera Mount”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON SL FPV Camera Mount V1 - V2”.
